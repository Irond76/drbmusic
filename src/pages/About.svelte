      It's been more than a few decades now, since I first heard Ace Frehley
      ripping his guitar solo on: Shock Me, off of the Kiss Alive II album. I
      remember hearing that track and knew immediately that I wanted to play
      guitar. I got my first guitar when I was 10, and I was hooked.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm heavily influenced by a vast genre of music. I really can't put my
      sound into a box. I have a great amount of respect for all artist's and
      their craft. Of course, like so many, some of my biggest influences are:
      Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Randy Rhoads and Van Halen. I also really
      enjoy: Buddy Holly, Stevie Ray, and a ton of The 80's bands I grew up
      listening to.
    </p>
    <p>So needless to say, the music I write reflects that.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I write what I enjoy; sometimes that's an angry rock song, other times
      it's bluesy and you can never go wrong with a soft ballad.

      I love creating with every instrument: guitars, drums, bass, piano etc. I
      dig the whole recording process. The mixing, mastering, and putting all
      the layers together to make something expressive. I record in my home
      studio that I have dubbed: "Proud Sounds Studio." I hope you enjoy my
      music; and I look forward to creating alot more in the future.
